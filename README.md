## rubycards

I just felt like writing some Ruby.

### About

Rubycards is a library to emulate playing cards (cards, hands, decks). As an added bonus, you can display the cards as tiny pictures. I'm mainly doing this as an exercise to learn better Ruby organization, as well as documentation and testing. More importantly it's just fun.

Feel free to peek around my code and point out anything I'm bad at.

### Example

To see an example, run

    ruby lib/rubycards.rb

### To do

* Make this into a gem
* Documentation
* Testing
* Some extensions for card games (poker, war, etc.)
